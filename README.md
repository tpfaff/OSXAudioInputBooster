# OSXAudioInputBooster
Used to fix a bug where OSX audio input goes to 0 over and over. Audio input is boosted to 100 in a configurable interval.


<b>Usage:</b>

Place the .sh file in your desired directory

While you're in the same directory, run the script via ./audio_input_max_loop.sh

Let it run for as long as you want
